# department-portal
This is an example Department Portal built by dedicated development team members at SC:FL
This Github Repo is an example, this is **NOT** actively synced with our actual department portal but yet an example on how we built it as it is today
Also note: our department portal was built from an FTP File Manager meaning instructions for copying this repo through an FTP Command Line will be unavailable.
